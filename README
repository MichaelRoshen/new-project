if you have install the git  on your computer and you have a github account,  and you want to use github to manage your project , you should config it first
 
1. generate ssh-key, here is my email address, then you can get three files, if_rsa.pub is what we want
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "michael_roshen@163.com"
 
Ruby代码  
$ cd ~/.ssh  
$ ls  
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts  
 
2. open the id_rsa.pub with vim and copy it to your github
open https://github.com/settings/ssh to add the ssh key
 
3. test, run this command, then you can get the cuccess message
ssh -T git@github.com
